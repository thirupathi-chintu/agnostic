terraform module
===========

Sample terraform config that uses the modular Terraform Azure configs. A virtual network with a public and private subnet (and associated route tables) is created. Two private Ubuntu 16 VMs are created in the private subnet. One static IP address is provided - this is assigned to one VM; the other gets a dynamic IP.


Input Variables
----------------------

- `base_name` - Used to generate names for all the resources created. Keep it short and DNS compliant
- `tags` - dictionary of tags that will be added to resources created by the module
- `location` - Azure location (e.g., West US')
- `ssh_public_keyfile` - the filename of the public rsa key used to ssh into the Ubuntu VM


Usage
-----

```
terraform apply -var 'base_name=alpha' -var 'location="West US"' -var 'ssh_public_keyfile=my_key.pub'
```
